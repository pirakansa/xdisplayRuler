# xdisplay-ruler Migration Handoff

Status: Stage 2 implemented

Audience: worker responsible for this `xdisplay-ruler` repository.

This document is self-contained. It describes the work for `xdisplay-ruler`
without requiring access to the future `xdisplay-attach` repository.

## Objective

Keep `xdisplay-ruler` focused on observing X11 output/window state and enforcing
kiosk window layouts on already active outputs.

Display pipeline control should be removed from `xdisplay-ruler` after a
separate tool provides replacement coverage. In this context, display pipeline
control means output activation, output deactivation, CRTC assignment, output
mode selection, output position, output rotation, and RandR root screen sizing.

## Current Repository Context

`xdisplay-ruler` currently includes both:

- window and layout behavior: snapshots, watch, window raise/lower,
  move/resize, fullscreen placement, and layout enforcement;
- display pipeline behavior: output mode listing and output mode switching.

The migration goal is to keep the first group and remove the second group once
replacement behavior exists in another tool or the breaking change is explicitly
approved.

## Responsibility to Preserve

Preserve these `xdisplay-ruler` responsibilities:

- Observe current X11/RandR output state.
- Observe root-level X11 window state.
- Print snapshots.
- Watch display and window changes.
- Raise and lower selected windows.
- Move and resize selected windows.
- Place selected windows on already active output geometry.
- Enforce kiosk layouts against already active outputs.
- Report missing or disconnected outputs clearly.

## Responsibility to Remove or Avoid

Do not add new display pipeline responsibilities to `xdisplay-ruler`.

After replacement coverage exists in a separate display pipeline tool or the
breaking change is explicitly approved, remove these responsibilities from
`xdisplay-ruler`:

- selecting output modes;
- switching output modes;
- activating inactive outputs;
- disabling outputs;
- assigning CRTCs;
- changing output rotation;
- resizing the RandR root screen as a display pipeline operation;
- recovering HDMI hotplug by creating the output pipeline.

`enforce` must not implicitly enable an output or change an output mode.

## Required Migration Stages

### Stage 1: Preserve Behavior While Boundary Is Draft

Do not break existing users during planning.

- Keep existing commands working.
- Keep existing tests passing.
- Do not remove `mode` or `modes` until replacement coverage exists or the user
  explicitly approves a breaking change.
- Do not update user-facing docs to claim behavior has changed before code
  changes land.

### Stage 2: Remove Pipeline Commands

When replacement coverage exists elsewhere or the user explicitly approves the
breaking change, remove the pipeline commands without a deprecation window.

Removal behavior should:

- remove `mode` command parsing and execution;
- remove `modes` command parsing and execution unless retained as a read-only
  observation command by explicit decision;
- remove output mode switching implementation from this repository;
- remove docs that describe `xdisplay-ruler` as a mode control tool;
- keep observation models only where they support snapshots, watch, placement,
  and layout enforcement.

## Layout Enforcement Contract

`enforce` should operate only on outputs already visible to Xorg/RandR.

Required behavior:

- If a layout references a missing output, report the missing output clearly.
- If a layout references a disconnected or inactive output, report the problem
  clearly.
- Do not try to create, attach, or enable the output.
- Do not change output mode, rotation, or root screen size.
- Place windows using the output geometry that is already active.

This keeps hotplug recovery ordered as:

```text
display pipeline tool sets active outputs
  -> xdisplay-ruler enforces window layout
```

## Documentation Work

When behavior changes are implemented:

- Update user guides to describe `xdisplay-ruler` as operating on already active
  outputs.
- Update specifications so they list only implemented `xdisplay-ruler`
  behavior.
- Remove or rewrite output mode user guidance if `mode` and `modes` are removed.
- In PR descriptions, state whether there are "No documentation changes" or
  list the updated docs.

Do not update the top-level README as if planned behavior is already
implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Existing non-pipeline behavior remains covered by tests.
- `enforce` does not enable outputs or change output modes.
- Missing outputs remain clear user-facing errors or warnings according to the
  existing enforce mode.
- CLI help, specifications, user guides, and tests no longer advertise removed
  pipeline commands.
- `vorbere run check`, `vorbere run test`, and `vorbere run build` pass before
  handoff completion.

## Non-Goals

- Do not implement the new display pipeline tool in this repository as part of
  this migration handoff.
- Do not add udev/systemd hotplug recovery implementation to `xdisplay-ruler`.
- Do not add direct DRM/KMS control to `xdisplay-ruler`.
- Do not make `enforce` select output modes.
- Do not remove existing commands before replacement coverage or explicit
  approval.

## Risks and Constraints

- Removing `mode` and `modes` is a breaking CLI change and requires replacement
  coverage or explicit approval.
- Some output mode listing code may look read-only, but it still belongs to the
  display pipeline area if it is documented as mode-management workflow.
- Touch remapping currently tied to mode changes may need a migration decision
  if mode changes leave this repository.
- This repository's documentation policy requires all documentation to be in
  English.

## Open Questions

- Should touch input remapping move out with display pipeline mode changes?
